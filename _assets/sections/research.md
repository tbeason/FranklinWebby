@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 A Labor Share for Consumption-Based Asset Pricing @@
@@mb-0 _Job Market Paper_ Draft coming soon.@@
I provide a framework for making any discrete time representative agent consumption-based asset pricing model simultaneously consistent with a number of stylized facts about aggregate labor income growth, labor's share of consumption, and growth rates in stock market dividends. The modification is parsimonious in that it adds only 4 parameters which are directly tied to observable features of the labor share. Within the framework, the labor share becomes a priced risk factor. I showcase a simple consumption-based asset pricing model within the framework and contrast its behavior to the same model with an explicit process for dividend growth. In addition to matching the standard macroeconomic moments targeted by most consumption-based asset pricing models, the model reproduces the term structures of growth rate volatility and provides a partial explanation of recent evidence about asymmetric dependence between consumption and dividend growth rates.

We use options and return data to decompose unconditional risk premia
into different parts of the return state space. In the data, the entire equity
premium is attributable to monthly returns below -11.3%, but returns in the
extreme left tail matter very little. In contrast, leading asset pricing models
based on habits, long-run risks, and rare disasters attribute the premium almost
exclusively to returns above -11.3%, or to the extreme left tail. We find
that model extensions with a larger quantity of tail risk cannot account for
the data, while models with a higher price of tail risk can.



@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 The Anatomy of Trading Algorithms @@

We study the anatomy of four widely used standardized institutional trading algorithms
representing \$675 billion in demand from 961 institutions between 2012 and 2016. The central tradeoff in these algorithms is between the desire to trade and transaction costs. Large parent orders generate hundreds of child orders which strategically employ the price, time, and display priority rules embodied in market structure to navigate this tradeoff. The distribution of child orders is non-random, generating strategic runs which oscillate between providing and taking liquidity. Price impact occurs both at the time an order is submitted to the book (regardless of whether it is filled), and at the time of execution. Passive child orders have much lower likelihood of execution but still incur substantial price impact. Conversely, marketable orders, even though immediately executable, do not necessarily guarantee execution and generate even larger price impact.





@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 Heterogeneity and Household Portfolio Choice @@
@@mb-0 Draft coming soon.@@
I study the distributional properties of household risky shares, the fraction of their financial portfolio allocated to risky assets. Many proposed solutions to bring household life-cycle portfolio choice models in line with the average risky share, such as participation costs or differences in labor income risk profiles, fall far short of generating sufficient cross-sectional heterogeneity in portfolio allocations at nearly every point in the life-cycle. I discuss what might be done to overcome these shortcomings and the implications for investors.




@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 Analyzing the Risks to Retirement Wealth @@
@@mb-0 Draft coming soon.@@
Articles written in popular press about "this risk" and "that risk" to your retirement wealth are too numerous to count. I provide a clean, tractable way to analyze the risks to financial wealth at the time of retirement. The framework operates under minimal assumptions about the financial portfolio returns and does not require the use of Monte Carlo simulations or assumptions about investor risk preferences. I relate a number of oft-discussed risks, such as sequence-of-return risk, stock market crashes, and long-term underperformance, back to the fundamental concepts of risk and return, risk exposures, and diversification. I show how investors and practitioners alike can integrate the analysis into their optimization problems. A scenario analysis demonstrates the largest risks for different types of retirement savers.

@@font-weight-bold,mb-0 Simulation of a Financial Market: The Possibility of Catastrophic Disequilibrium @@
@@mb-0 with Amit Sinha, Kelly Roos, & Philip Horvath.  _Chaos, Solitons, & Fractals_, 2019, 125, 13-16. [Publisher Link](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077919301705) @@
We use kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to produce solutions of an agent-based, rate equation model of an informationally efficient, closed financial market. The simulations produce a crash in the market that is forewarned through the observation of a market instability from which the market temporarily recovers. The market remained in a quasi-stable state for a relatively large amount of time between the warning and the crash, raising the prospect that some mitigating action can be taken in time to avert the impending crash. This result has strong ramifications for the future of predicting calamitous market events, especially if some observable aspect of financial markets can be positively identified and associated with simulation parameters.
