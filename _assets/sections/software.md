# Code

I am a proponent of open source software and transparent academic research. I am an active member of the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) community.

In addition to contributing to existing Julia packages, I maintain a number of packages I found useful in my own work. I hope that other finance researchers and practitioners can find value in them as well.

 * [FamaFrenchData.jl](https://github.com/tbeason/FamaFrenchData.jl) -- cleanly pull data directly from the Ken French Data Library
 * [DailyTreasuryYieldCurve.jl](https://github.com/tbeason/DailyTreasuryYieldCurve.jl) -- efficiently pull yield curves directly from the US Treasury
 * [FinancialPortfolios.jl](https://github.com/tbeason/FinancialPortfolios.jl) -- convenience package for working with portfolios
 * [AsymmetricRisk.jl](https://github.com/tbeason/AsymmetricRisk.jl) -- implements a number of univariate and bivariate asymmetric risk measures (WIP)

This website is also [open source](https://github.com/tbeason/tbeason.github.io).
